# Privacy Policy for Yenom

**Last Updated: December 27, 2025**

## Introduction

Yenom ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how Yenom handles your information when you use our subscription tracking application.

## Our Privacy Philosophy

**Yenom is privacy-first by design.** We believe your financial information is personal and should remain private. That's why we've built Yenom to store all your data locally on your device with no external servers, no user accounts, and no tracking.

## Information We Collect

### Data You Provide
When you use Yenom, you create subscription records that include:
- Subscription names (e.g., "Netflix", "Spotify")
- Payment amounts
- Payment frequencies (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
- Next payment dates
- Optional notes about subscriptions

### Data Stored Locally
All of this information is stored **only on your device** using Apple's SwiftData framework. We do not transmit, upload, or sync this data to any external servers.

### Data We Don't Collect
- ❌ No personal identifying information (name, email, phone number)
- ❌ No location data
- ❌ No browsing history or app usage tracking
- ❌ No analytics or crash reporting to third parties
- ❌ No advertising identifiers
- ❌ No device information beyond what iOS provides for app functionality

## How We Use Your Information

Your subscription data is used solely for:
1. **Displaying your subscriptions** in the app interface
2. **Calculating totals** (monthly and yearly costs)
3. **Scheduling notifications** to remind you of upcoming payments
4. **Showing calendar visualization** of your payment schedule

All processing happens **locally on your device**. We never access, view, or transmit your data.

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage
- All data is stored in your device's local database using SwiftData
- Data is protected by your device's security measures (passcode, Face ID, Touch ID)
- Data is included in your device's encrypted backup (iCloud or iTunes)

### No Cloud Storage
Yenom does not currently use cloud storage or synchronization. Your data exists only on your device unless you manually back up your device.

### Device Backups
If you back up your device to iCloud or iTunes, your Yenom data will be included in that backup. This is controlled by your device's backup settings, not by Yenom.

## Notifications

Yenom requests permission to send you local notifications to remind you of upcoming payments. These notifications:
- Are generated **locally** on your device
- Do not transmit data to external servers
- Can be customized or disabled in the app's Settings
- Can be completely disabled in iOS Settings → Notifications → Yenom

## Data Sharing

**We do not share your data. Period.**

Yenom does not:
- Share data with third parties
- Sell your data
- Use your data for advertising
- Transmit your data over the internet
- Provide your data to analytics services

## Third-Party Services

Yenom does **not** integrate with any third-party services, APIs, or SDKs that could access your data.

## Your Data Rights

### Access
You have full access to your data within the app. You can view, edit, or delete any subscription at any time.

### Deletion
You can delete individual subscriptions by swiping left on any item and tapping "Delete."

To delete all your data:
1. Delete the Yenom app from your device
2. All subscription data will be permanently removed

### Export (Coming Soon)
We're working on adding an export feature to allow you to export your subscription data to CSV or JSON format for backup or transfer purposes.

## Children's Privacy

Yenom does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13. The app is suitable for all ages and does not contain any content that would require parental consent.

## Changes to Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do:
- We will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy
- Significant changes will be communicated through the App Store update notes
- Continued use of the app after changes indicates acceptance of the new policy

## Data Retention

Your subscription data is retained on your device until you:
- Manually delete individual subscriptions
- Delete the Yenom app entirely
- Restore your device without restoring from backup

## International Users

Yenom is designed to work worldwide and automatically adapts to your device's locale:
- Currency symbols match your region (£, $, €, etc.)
- Date formats match your regional settings
- All processing happens locally on your device regardless of location

## California Privacy Rights (CCPA)

Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), California residents have specific rights regarding their personal information. However, since Yenom does not collect, store, or process any personal information on servers, these rights are automatically protected:
- **Right to Know**: All your data is visible within the app
- **Right to Delete**: Delete subscriptions at any time, or delete the app
- **Right to Opt-Out**: No data is collected or sold, so opt-out is not applicable
- **Right to Non-Discrimination**: Not applicable as we don't collect data

## European Privacy Rights (GDPR)

For users in the European Economic Area (EEA), UK, and Switzerland:

### Legal Basis
Since Yenom processes all data locally on your device and doesn't transmit data to servers, traditional GDPR obligations don't apply. However, we respect the spirit of GDPR:
- **Consent**: By using the app, you consent to local data storage
- **Data Minimization**: We only store what you explicitly enter
- **Purpose Limitation**: Data is used only for subscription tracking
- **Storage Limitation**: Data is kept only as long as you keep it

### Your Rights
- **Right to Access**: View all your data in the app
- **Right to Rectification**: Edit subscriptions at any time
- **Right to Erasure**: Delete subscriptions or the entire app
- **Right to Data Portability**: Currently manual; export feature coming soon
- **Right to Object**: Don't enter data you don't want stored

## Open Source

While Yenom's source code is currently proprietary, we're committed to transparency. If you have technical questions about how we handle data, please contact us.

- **Export/Import**: Will remain local-only (no server uploads)
- **Bank Integration**: If added, will use secure, authorized APIs with explicit user consent

Any feature that changes how we handle data will require:
